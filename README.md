# Description
This project is an interactive number guessing game where players try to guess a certain range of number(between 1 and 100). In this first part, I focused on building the core game logic—setting up the rules, handling user input, and providing feedback to the player. It’s a fun introduction to programming fundamentals, including conditionals, loops, and user interaction, while laying the groundwork for a fully functional game experience.
